;;Applicative-order evaluation, the evaluation of (test 0 (p)) never terminates, because (p) is infinitely expanded to itself

;; (test 0 (p)) 
  
;; (test 0 (p)) 
  
;; (test 0 (p)) 


;;Normal-order evaluation, the expression evaluates to 0:

;; (test 0 (p)) 
  
;; (if (= 0 0) 0 (p)) 
  
;; (if #t 0 (p)) 
  
;; 0
